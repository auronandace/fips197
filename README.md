# fips197
A 0 dependency, no_std implementation of AES128, AES192 and AES256 ciphers.

## Motivation
I wanted to see if I could implement AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) by reading the specifications. The examples in the specifications helped me to formulate the tests to prove I have implemented it correctly.
